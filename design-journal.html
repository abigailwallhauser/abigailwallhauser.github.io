        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response: I hope that I become more comfortable making websites by the end of this term. I don't know much about website design, so I'm just looking forward to the experience and having fun with it.</p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter? </p>
        <p>Response: I'm planning on making a site showing either people/places I visited for the first time since quarantine began or beaches I visited. I haven't finished my wireframes yet, so the topic is still undecided. I think each page will feel different because I want it to be a reflection of the subject I'm talking about. While I think my typography will be consistent, the imagery and colors will likely change based on subject matter.</p>
